                main ambition is to become a pirate. Eating the Gum-Gum Fruit gives him strange powers but also invokes
                the fruit's curse: anybody who consumes it can never learn to swim. Nevertheless, Monkey and his
                crewmate Roronoa Zoro, master of the three-sword fighting style, sail the Seven Seas of swashbuckling
                adventure in search of the elusive treasure "One Piece."
